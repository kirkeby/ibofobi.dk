GZipMiddleware
==============

I just implemented a GZipMiddleware for Django,
so now you can enjoy the bandwidth-saving goodness
that is gzip without
using django.middleware.cache (actually, since
Djangos cache-middleware is oblivious to the Vary
header, it will _not_ work with GZipMiddleware...)

It is in ibofobi.middleware.gzip under
`svn://ibofobi.dk/public/trunk/ibofobi/`. Enjoy.
