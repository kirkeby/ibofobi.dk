myTunes: Music-library and player
=================================

myTunes is my own music-library and player. I wrote it primarily because I wanted a music player with an iTunes-like rating system; so I can play my entire music collection on random, and mostly hear my favourite music.

Notable features:

* Plays MP3 and Ogg files
* iTunes-inspired rating system
* Random playback will mostly play your favourite music
* Keeps your music files organized in a nice directory-structure
* Keeps your ID3 tags and Ogg metainformation updated
* Imports ID3 tags and Ogg metainformation

Coming features:

* UI for tagging your music (e.g. this is music for hacking sessions)
* Filters for the random playback mode (e.g. don't play classical music right now)
* UI for browsing your music library (by artist, by rating, etc)
* UI for searching your music library
* Playlists

It's written in Python and uses [Durus](http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/durus/) to keep it's database and [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/) to play your music.
