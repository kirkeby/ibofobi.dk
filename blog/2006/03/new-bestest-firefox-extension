New bestest Firefox extension
=============================

I have a new favourite Firefox extension: [click2tab](http://click2tab.mozdev.org/).

I can't count how many times I have pressed ctrl+w in a Firefox textarea, trying to rub out
the last word I wrote, and instead been faced with loosing my entire browser. "Grrrr," is
my usual response to this.

In my opinion Firefox should recognize that ctrl+w in a textarea very probably is
a Unix person making a bad mistake. Alas, it does not. [click2tab](http://click2tab.mozdev.org/)
does not save me from making the mistake, but it lets me undo the close tab operation.
Which is just as swell.

Yay!
