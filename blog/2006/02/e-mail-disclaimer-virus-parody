E-mail-disclaimer-virus parody
==============================

Noticed this gem in Carlo C8E Miron's signature:

> Disclaimer:
> If I receive a message from you, you are agreeing that:
> 1. I am by definition, "the intended recipient".
> 2. All information in the email is mine to do with as I see fit and
>  make such financial profit, political mileage, or good joke as it
>  lends itself to. In particular, I may quote it on USENET or the WWW.
> 3. I may take the contents as representing the views of your company.
> 4. This overrides any disclaimer or statement of confidentiality that
>  may be included on your message.

That very nicely sums up how I feel about the e-mail-disclaimer virus, which
seem to have infected a large number of work-computers.
