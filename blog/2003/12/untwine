Template Untwining
==================

<p>I am thinking about reverse-template engines, that is engines for
taking templates and their instances and extracting the data that was
filled into the templates.</p>
<p>For example if I have the Zope Page Template:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>
&lt;h1 tal:content='document/title'&gt;<span class='shy'> </span>Document Title Goes
Here&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></p></blockquote>
<p>And this instance of it:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Rampaging Rucksacks Ravage Rome&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></p></blockquote>
<p>I would like an automated way of extracting
<var>document/title</var>, possibly getting this Python data
structure:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>
{ 'document/title': 'Rampaging Rucksacks Ravage Rome', }
</code></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, I should probably head off to my trusted editor, write a few
unittests and see if I can't hack together something to satisfy
them.</p>
