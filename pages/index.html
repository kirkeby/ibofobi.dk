<h1>about:me</h1>

<p>In case anyone is wondering, my name is Sune Kirkeby.

This is a site for my programming related projects, I also keep a
personal site for random blurts and minor hackativity at <a
href='/blog/'>http://ibofobi.dk/blog/</a>. If you feel like
contacting me there is a <a href='/contact/'>contact
form</a> that you can use.</p>

<h1>Honourable Mentions</h1>

<p>These are a few of the things I have committed in the name of Happy
Hacking. Please forgive me my sins.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href='/stuff/entwine/'>Entwine</a></dt>
<dd>My own reimplementation of Zope Page Templates.</dd>

<dt><a href='/stuff/skewed/'>Skewed</a></dt>
<dd>My own WSGI web framework/library/thingy.</dd>

<dt><a href='/stuff/hurd-entropy/'><code>/dev/{,u}random</code>
driver for GNU/Hurd</a></dt>
<dd>A port of the Linux <code>/dev/{,u}random</code> driver to
GNU/Hurd.</dd>

<dt><a href='/download/portalfs.tar.gz'>user-space portals</a></dt>
<dd>An user-space implementation of the old portals concept from BSD4.4;
this is for UNIXen that dynamically link executables. If you have no
idea what I am talking about you might want to read <a

W. Richard Stevens and Jan-Simon Pendry.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Other than the above Honourable Mentions I have produced patches for
various free software projects. <a
href='http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Sune%20Kirkeby%22'>Googling for
my name</a> usually turn up these (along with a lot of other stuff about
me and by me).</p>
