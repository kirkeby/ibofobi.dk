<p>These are a few of the things I have committed in the name of Happy
Hacking. Please forgive my sins.</p>

<!-- FIXME - cut'n'pasted from stuff/ -->
<dl>
<dt><a href='stuff/mp3/'>Python MP3</a></dt>
<dd>Some Python code to parse MP3 files and ID3 tags.</dd>

<dt><a href='stuff/hurd-entropy/'><code>/dev/{,u}random</code>
driver for GNU/Hurd</a></dt>
<dd>A port of the Linux <code>/dev/{,u}random</code> driver to
GNU/Hurd.</dd>

<dt><a href='download/portalfs.tar.gz'>user-space portals</a></dt>
<dd>An user-space implementation of the old portals concept from BSD4.4;
this is for UNIXen that dynamically link executables. If you have no
idea what I am talking about you might want to read <a
href='http://www.kohala.com/start/portals.ps'>Portals in 4.4BSD</a> by
W. Richard Stevens and Jan-Simon Pendry.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Other than the above Honourable Mentions I have produced patches for
various free software projects. <a

my name</a> usually turn up these (along with a lot of other stuff about
me and by me).</p>
