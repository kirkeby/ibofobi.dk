<h3>/dev/{,u}random for GNU/Hurd</h3>

<p>This is a port of the Linux /dev/{,u}random device driver, it is still
incomplete (lacks the in-kernel entropy gathering), atm. it only
generates randomness of the same order as /dev/random under Linux, when
the entropy pool is empty.</p>

<p>This port is part user-space and part in-kernel (lacking), the
user-space part consists of two translators:</p>
<dl>
<dt>entropy</dt>
<dd>gathers entropy and generates random data from it.</dd>
<dt>random</dt>
<dd>/dev/{,u}random translator (uses entropy)</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>I really have no qualifications that would allow me to undertake
something as requiring security-wise as this, so this stuff might very
well not be secure at all.</p>


<h3>Compilation</h3>

<p>I haven't autoconf-ified this yet, so</p>

<blockquote><p><samp>$</samp> <kbd>make</kbd></p></blockquote>

<p>should do to compile both entropy and random.</p>

<h3>Setup</h3>

<p>This is how I have installed entropy and random (the install.sh script
does this):</p>

<blockquote><p>
<pre>$ cp random entropy /hurd
$ settrans -cg /servers/entropy
$ chmod 0600 /servers/entropy
$ settrans /servers/entropy /hurd/entropy
$ settrans -cg /dev/random
$ chmod 0444 /dev/random
$ settrans /dev/random /hurd/random --blocking
$ settrans -cg /dev/urandom
$ chmod 0444 /dev/urandom
$ settrans /dev/urandom /hurd/random --unblocking</pre>
</p></blockquote>

<p>After this is done you probably want to install the Entropy Gathering
Daemon and setup it and egd_glue to run at system startup, so your
entropy pool won't be empty.  If egd is connected to a socket, say
/var/run/egd (egd_glue does not support ip sockets), you just have to
insert a command like this into your system startup script of
choice:</p>

<blockquote><p><kbd>/usr/local/bin/egd_glue --entropy /servers/entropy --egd /var/run/egd</kbd></p></blockquote>

<p>The included script rc.egd can be placed in /etc/init.d and installed via
update-rc.d on Debian systems:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre># cp rc.egd /etc/init.d/egd
# update-rc.d egd start 05 2 3 4 5 . stop 95 0 1 6 .</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>GNU/Mach Entropy Device</h3>

<p>If you want even better entropy that can be gathered by the Entropy
Gathering Daemon, you might want to create a special GNU/Mach kernel, by
patching a recent CVS snapshot with the included gnumach-entropy.diff
patch-file, and configuring it with --enable-entropy.  This adds a special
entropy device to your kernel, which the entropy translator automagically
will use to get entropy gathered by your kernel.  This is a Good
Thing(tm).</p>

<p>If you do this you can ignore the instructions on setting up the Entropy
Gathering Daemon and egd_glue.</p>

<h3>Author</h3>

<p>The entropy gathering and hashing was ripped from a 2.2.11 Linux kernel, 
much of the trivfs code was inspired (or just plain ripped) from  
/src/hurd/trans/null.c and /src/hurd/trans/hello*.c.  It was all done by
Sune Kirkeby (the ripping and glueing back together, that is).</p>
