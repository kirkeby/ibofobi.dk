<h1>Sheared</h1>

<p>Sheared is a library for network programming in Stackless Python.
Where traditional network programming would uses threads or processes
Sheared uses stackless tasklets, but all blocking operations go through
a reactor tasklet. In this way the best of asynchronous (no resource
locking to worry about) and synchronous (no need to split code into
different call-backs at blocking operations, e.g. database queries)
network programming is combined.</p>

<p>I have taken liberal amounts of inspiration from the <a
href='http://www.twistedmatrix.com/'>Twisted</a> crowd in writing
Sheared, but luckily I have not yet caught the Framework Bug from them.
Alas, since Sheared is presently a one-man project, Twisted is a much
more mature project, and has many more features.</p>

<p>Currently Sheared has support for TCP and UNIX sockets (others
supported in in the BSD sockets interface should be simple to support),
and it comes with it's own web-server. Linux is the only platform known
to be supported, but others with reasonable BSD-socket and
<tt>select(2)</tt> implementations should work also.</p>

<p>So far Sheared has (to my knowledge :-) only been used in one
publicly available project: <a href='/stuff/jukebox/'>Jukebox</a>, my own
MP3 streaming server with built-in web- and telnet-admin interfaces.</p>
