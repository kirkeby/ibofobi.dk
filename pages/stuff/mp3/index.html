<p>This is a library for reading MP3-files in Python and some tools for
working with MP3-files on the command-line. At present the library can
read MP3-frame meta-data and has support for ID3v1 tags.</p>

<p>The library is very strict in what MP3-files it can read,
unforunately many MP3-files that exist in the wild are broken in one or
more ways (most MP3 players just skip past bad data, without ever
mentioning it). So, included with the library is a tool to extract all
the good data (MP3 frames and all ID3 tags) from MP3-files.</p>

<p>The library and tools are licensed under the GNU General Public
License, and is copyright &copy; 2003-2004 Sune Kirkeby.</p>
