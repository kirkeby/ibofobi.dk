Sune Kirkeby \\
Living: Copenhagen, Denmark \\

I am a self-described hacker\footnote{hacker: n.;  person who enjoys exploring
the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities,
[..] -- \href{http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html}{Jargon File}.}.
I am passionate about software development, always trying to improve the
processes that support the development, and teaching myself new skills. I like
to know as much as I can about the systems I work with; for example everything
from the low-level implementation details of data-storage in databases, the
details of network protocols, to how a browser renders a web-site.
When not around a computer I read (mostly science fiction), cook and exercise
(squash and swimming).

I currently live in the greater Copenhagen area, and work as a software
developer at the network-security company CSIS. I hold a bachelors degree in
computer science from the university of Copenhagen.

\section{\mysidestyle Skills}\vspace{1mm}
\begin{description}
\item[Software Development] I am used to both designing and implementing new
systems from the ground up, and re-architect existing systems to improve them.
This involves everything from unit-testing code, to designing database
schemas, automating deployments and working with system administrators to
estimate hardware needs.
\item[Databases] I have experience with SQL databases, key-value stores and
various custom data-storage solutions optimized for a given problem.
\item[Programming Languages] Professionally most of my programming experience
is in Python. I can read and write C code, shell scripts, and Perl.  And I
have some experience with Standard ML, Haskell and JavaScript.

the University of Copenhagen.
\item[1998] Borupgaard Amtsgymnasium -- High school.
\end{description}

\section{\mysidestyle Work Experience}\vspace{1mm}
\begin{description}
\item[2008 $\rightarrow$ Present] Software Developer at CSIS A/S. My primary
role is design and development of the backends for the Secure DNS and eCrime
products.  I have also worked to improve the in-house development processes,
by introducing automated software testing and deployment, and daily scrum
meetings.

\item[2007 $\rightarrow$ 2008] Software Developer at Netpointers Technologies
A/S. My primary role was development of the in-house web-crawler and its
customer-facing report-generating web-site. I was one of the primary
developers designing and implementing a much-improved web-crawler backend.

\item[2005 $\rightarrow$ 2007] Part-time Systems Administrator at Netpointers
Technologies A/S. My primary role was as Linux systems administrator, handling
the daily running of the Linux-servers of the company. I created the backup
and disaster recovery procedures, and configured the open source
backup-softwar Amanda needed to support these. I also helped to configure and
optimize the backend systems, primarly the Oracle and PostgreSQL databases
used by the on-house web-crawler.


\item[2000 $\rightarrow$ 2005] Part-time Systems Administrator at <silvertag>
/ a-host.dk. My primary role was as Linux systems administrator, handling the
daily running of the DNS, mail and web-servers of the company. I also did some
in-house development of web-based systems to ease the configuration of the
web- and mail-hosting business, and a custom spam and virus
mail-gateway.

\item[1998 $\rightarrow$ 2000] Software Developer at Berlingske Online. 
My primary role was backend development for the web-sites of Berlingske
Online: The on-line version of the Berlingske news-paper www.berlingske.dk,
the home-grown publication-system for www.berlingske.dk, and the job-searching
site www.jobzonen.dk. I also handled the system administration of the servers
for the sites until a dedicated systems adminstrator was hired.
