ibofobi.apps.scryer
===================

Scryer is a page-view counter for your Django site, I wrote it after getting
fed up with webalizer, and noticing how utterly cool
[Mint](http://www.haveamint.com/) is. It uses XMLHttpRequest to call back for
every page-view; browsers without javascript are not currently supported,
although it should be pretty simple to implement.

It's still very pre-alpha, mostly because it has none of the cool
display-features of Mint. For now there are views for (the links are to
scrapes of the views):

 * [referrers](http://media.ibofobi.dk/scryer/scrapes/referrers/)
 * [top pages](http://media.ibofobi.dk/scryer/scrapes/top-pages/)
 * [sessions](http://media.ibofobi.dk/scryer/scrapes/sessions/) (aka visits)
 * [live pages](http://media.ibofobi.dk/scryer/scrapes/page-views/) (aka last 10 page-views)

Installing
==========

Get the source
--------------

I have not yet bothered with packaging scryer, so if you want to play, you
have to get the source from the
[github](http://github.com/kirkeby/django-stuff/).

Install the application
-----------------------

Insert into

 * `INSTALLED_APPS`:

        "ibofobi.apps.scryer"
 * `urls/main`:

        (r'^scryer/', include('ibofobi.apps.scryer.urls.public')),
 * `urls/admin`:

        (r'^scryer/generated/', include('ibofobi.apps.scryer.urls.admin')),

And run:

    django-admin.py install scryer


Copy `src/ibofobi/apps/scryer/media/scryer/pageview.js` into your
media-directory and include it 
(`<script type='text/javascript' src='.../pageview.js'></script>`)
in the top of all the pages you want to count page-views for.

Upgrading from fresh
--------------------

The models changed from fresh to scryer, if you want your old page-views still
follow UpgradeFreshToScryer.

Rejoice

Look at `/scryer/generated/referrers/` on your admin-site. Rejoice! :)
