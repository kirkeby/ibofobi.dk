ibofobi.apps.blog
=================

A simple one-person blog. Included batteries:

 * Posts written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
 * Categories
 * Comments written in a safe subset of Markdown
 * Latest-posts feeds (both overall and per-category)

Installation
============

Get the code
------------

The code is available on [github](http://github.com/kirkeby/django-stuff/).

Add to your Django project
--------------------------

Now you must add the app to your Django project, to do this you must add

    'ibofobi.apps.blog',

to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting. And make sure that either the `egg`-template
or the `app_directory`-template loader is in `TEMPLATE_LOADERS` (depending on whether you
installed as an egg or not).

Finally you should add 

    (r'^blog/', include('ibofobi.apps.blog.urls.blog')),
to your URL-settings, and define the following variables in your settings

    BLOG_URL = '/blog'
    BLOG_AUTHOR = 'Jane Dough' # sic :)
    BLOG_TITLE = 'My First Blog(tm)'
    BLOG_TAG_FORMAT = 'tag:example.com,%(year)d-%(month)02d-%(day)02d:/blog/archive/%(year)d/%(month)02d/%(day)02d/%(slug)s/'

Install model
-------------

Now you are ready to

    django-admin.py install blog

and everything should play.

Post
----

Now you can go to your admin-page, in under Blog, Posts, Add Post and make a
new post.  To make it public, remember to set the "Listed"-flag (this is
useful the other way, if you want to make drafts of your posts.)

Templates
=========

You probably want your blog to look more interesting than the default
templates (or at least different ;). To accomplish this you create a
`blog/base` template, which should define a `pagetitle` and `content` block
for the other blog-templates to fill. The default `blog/base` looks like this:

    {% extends "base" %}
    {% block title %}{% block pagetitle %}{% endblock %} [{{ settings.BLOG_TITLE }}]{% endblock %}

If you want to do more extensive changes to the templates, you can look at the 
[templates in subversion](http://code.ibofobi.dk/public/browser/trunk/ibofobi/src/ibofobi/apps/blog/templates/blog/).

Feedback
========

I'd love to hear from you, if you think the code is useful. So, drop me a mail (sune.kirkeby@gmail.com), or just add a blurb below here, if
you feel like it :)

Slightly incompatible with latest Django code
---------------------------------------------

If you are using django newer than revision [1443] you will get a errors about register_tag and escape.  You'll need to follow the advice at [Template system changes](http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/BackwardsIncompatibleChanges#Templatesystemchanges)(http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/1443) for registering and for filters.

Specifically, edit ibofobi/apps/blog/templatetags/safe_markdown.py and in the method pop_paragraph replace the line 

    return '<p>' + render_paragraph(escape('\n'.join(p), None)) + </p>
with 

    return '<p>' + render_paragraph(escape('\n'.join(p))) + </p>
eliminating the ", None". Next, replace the line at the end 

    template.register_filter('safe_markdown', render, False)
with 

    register = template.Library()
    register.filter('safe_markdown', render)
