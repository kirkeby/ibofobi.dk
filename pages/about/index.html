<p>First, I had better introduce myself, my name is Sune Kirkeby and I
am a compulsive <a

title='The Jargon File entry for &quot;hacker&quot;'>hacker</a>,
a <a

title='The Merriam-Webster Dictionary entry for
&quot;procrastinator&quot;'>procrastinator</a> of all things great and
small, and an avid <a href='/reading/'>consumer of litterature</a>.</p>

<p>I have a BSc in computer science from the University of Copenhagen, and I
work as a software engineer / system administrator at a small privately owned
company in Copenhagen, where I develop both in-house and customer facing
systems. I work both on the front- and back-ends of systems (everything from
making HTML and JavaScript work to tuning Postgresql databases and extracting
business reports via SQL is part of my daily work.)</p>

<p>I am passionate about developing software, and I am always trying to
better myself, both by looking for software which can help me; by
studying computer science and software engineering litterature [hacker's
litterature?], about anything from Haskell type-system wizardry to
parallel programming with Linda tuple-spaces, or large-scale web-site
deployments using Python, Perl or Ruby; and by practicing my craft,
by rewriting software I come into contact with, doing the occasional
code kata, or doing exercises anywhere I find them.</p>

<p>Also, when I fancy practicing my writing skills, or I have something
I want off my chest, I write <a href='/blog/'>rambling rants</a>.
Subjects you are likely to find me ramble about include <a

<abbr title='Hyper Text Markup Language'>HTML</abbr> and programming in
generel.</p>
