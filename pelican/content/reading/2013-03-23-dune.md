Title: Re-reading Dune
Status: draft

Dune is probably the book I have read the most times, I can always come back
to it and enjoy the things I can remember, and discover new things in it. This
time I decided to re-read the entire Dune series (not including the prequels,
of course), so it'll probably be a little while before I need a new book :)
