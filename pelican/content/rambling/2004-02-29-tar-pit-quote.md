Title: Interesting Brooks quote
Date: 2004-02-29

Today I began rereading Brooks's <i><a
href='http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,4096,0201835959,00.html'
title='Addison-Wesley page on The Mythical Man Month'>The Mythical Man
Month</a></i>, and in the first chapter, where Brooks talks about the
craft of programming, there is an interesting passage:

> The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially
> painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's
> programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely
> delivered (no source code or test cases), and poorly documented.

What a lovely idea, that source code is part of the complete software
package. Even though Brooks is only talking about delivering source code
to system programmers, I think the idea is much more broadly applicable.
The world of computing would be a much nicer placer, if source code was
a part of the software package normally, and not exceptionally as it is
today.
