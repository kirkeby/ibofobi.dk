<a href='http://wannabe.catharsis.org/bin/quiz.cgi?quiz=one'>Are You a
Blogaholic?</a> has this to say about me:

<blockquote><p><q
cite='http://wannabe.catharsis.org/bin/quiz.cgi?quiz=one'>You are a
casual weblogger. You only blog when you have nothing better to do,
which is not very often. There's nothing wrong with that. But if you'd
post a little more often, you'd make your readers very
happy.</q></p></blockquote>
