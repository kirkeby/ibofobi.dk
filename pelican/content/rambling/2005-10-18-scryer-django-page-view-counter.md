Title: Scryer: Django page-view counter
Date: 2005-10-18

My Django page-view counter got a decent name today. Yay! It's now called
Scryer. Thanks go to `iholsman` from `#django` for inspiration. The name
comes from:

> `scrying, n.; a method of divination in which one gazes at an object (crystal ball, water, candle) until prophetic visions appear.`

I think it's kind of appropriate, also I like the sound of it :)

Also, I implemented some new views for Scryer. Here are screen-scrapes
of them:

* [top pages](http://media.ibofobi.dk/scryer/scrapes/top-pages/)
* [sessions](http://media.ibofobi.dk/scryer/scrapes/sessions/) (aka visits)
* [live pages](http://media.ibofobi.dk/scryer/scrapes/page-views/) (aka last 10 page-views)

See [the trac page](http://code.ibofobi.dk/public/wiki/ProjectIbofobiScryer) for installation instructions.
