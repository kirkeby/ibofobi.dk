Title: Let's see if this works
Date: 2004-02-07

<p>I am curious as to how stupid spammers really are, so I have created
two very special e-mail addresses, and <a
href='http://honning.ibofobi.dk/'>broadcast their existence</a> to the
world. Now, I wonder, how long it will be before some spider finds its
way to them, and I start getting offers of unbelivable riches and bodily
improvements?</p>
