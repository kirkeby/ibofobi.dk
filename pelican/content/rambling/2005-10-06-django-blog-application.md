Title: Django blog application
Date: 2005-10-06

I have finished prepping my Django blog-app for distribution; it is now fairly user-friendly, and I even wrote an installation guide. I have spent some time making it work however you install it (I know it works running from a subversion checkout in `PYTHON_PATH` and from a Python egg).

See [the trac wiki](http://code.ibofobi.dk/public/wiki/ProjectIbofobiBlog) for more information.
