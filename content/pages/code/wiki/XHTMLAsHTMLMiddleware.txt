This is a piece of middleware for [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)
which will let you serve all your pages as XHTML, with the correct
Content-Type header `application/xhtml+xml`, and automagically have the
pages served as HTML 4.01 Strict with Content-Type `text/plain` to browser
that don't understand XHTML.
