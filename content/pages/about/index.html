  <p>First, I had better introduce myself, my name is Sune Kirkeby and I
  am a compulsive <a
  href='http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html'
  title='The Jargon File entry for &quot;hacker&quot;'>hacker</a>,
  a <a
  href='http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=procrastinator'
  title='The Merriam-Webster Dictionary entry for
  &quot;procrastinator&quot;'>procrastinator</a> of all things great and
  small, and an avid <a href='{{ SITEURL }}/reading/'>consumer of
  litterature</a>.</p>

  <p>I have a BSc in computer science from the University of Copenhagen, and I
  work as a software engineer / system administrator at a small privately owned
  company in Copenhagen, where I develop both in-house and customer facing
  systems. I work both on the front- and back-ends of systems (everything from
  making HTML and JavaScript work to tuning Postgresql databases and extracting
  business reports via SQL is part of my daily work.)</p>

  <p>I am passionate about developing software, and I am always trying to
  better myself, both by looking for software which can help me; by
  studying computer science and software engineering litterature [hacker's
  litterature?], about anything from Haskell type-system wizardry to
  parallel programming with Linda tuple-spaces, or large-scale web-site
  deployments using Python, Perl or Ruby; and by practicing my craft,
  by rewriting software I come into contact with, doing the occasional
  code kata, or doing exercises anywhere I find them.</p>

  <p>Also, when I fancy practicing my writing skills, or I have something
  I want off my chest, I write <a href='/blog/'>rambling rants</a>.
  Subjects you are likely to find me ramble about include <a

  <abbr title='Hyper Text Markup Language'>HTML</abbr> and programming in
  generel.</p>
