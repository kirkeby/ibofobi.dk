<h1>Jukebox</h1>

<h2>What is this?!</h2>

<p>Jukebox is an MP3 streaming server with built-in web- and telnet-admin
interfaces, and support for either acting as an encoder for an icecast
server or running it's own streaming server.</p>

<p>Jukebox has a two-level playlist, with the highest level being the
wishlist, and the lowest level being the randomized playlist. So, when
you wish one or more songs they will play in order, and when the
playlist is empty songs will be chosen at random from your MP3
directory.</p>
