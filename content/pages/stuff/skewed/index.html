<h1>Skewed</h1>

<p>Skewed is yet another framework/library/thingy for writing
web-applications in Python, it is built on top of <a
href='http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html'>WSGI</a>, <a
href='http://pythonpaste.org'>Paste</a> and <a
href='/stuff/entwine/'>Entwine</a>. I have not yet written any
documentation or examples, but I will get around to it.</p>

<h2>Get it</h2>

<p>The subversion repository is dead and buried, and I haven't had
time to convert it into git, so Entwine i off-line until forther
notice.</p>
